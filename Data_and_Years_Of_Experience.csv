We developed a method of real-time underwriting and, in doing so, reduced the months-long process of applying for life insurance to minutes.

We developed a method of real-time underwriting and, in doing so, reduced the months-long process of applying for life insurance to minutes. Our digital experience is quick (instant decisions!), loved by users (check out our Trustpilot or Google reviews) and prolific ($60 billion+ in coverage provided).
